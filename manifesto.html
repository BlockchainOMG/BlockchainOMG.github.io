    <p>Oh wow, you made it, you somehow tried to make the effort of clicking on this page despite your 'effortless living' theorem over scamming others. Before you continue reading, if you have any reading skills at all, just know that you're here because you know you're a fool. People on the internet, don't always click out of randomness, they click from self-awareness. I sent you this link, you clicked on it, and you either had two reactions. One was, 'Wow, haha, very funny but I'm going to continue scamming anyway' and the other was, 'Pfft, okay then, act like you're right'. You've admitted fault, and in the hierarchy of morons you live upon and are friends to, you simply are the one and only liar to the idiot. You are a semblance of parasitical behavior, a member of society overlooked, overshadowed, and overestimated until you prove to everyone that you're a below average clown. When you tried to scam me there, you must've been on your biggest power trip yet, the biggest one you had since your mother convinced you that you're a samaritan. Oh wait, she was lying to you, because in that situation? You were the idiot, the moron co-existing with the alcoholic. Oh wait, you thought she told you the truth that you were awesome? No, you weren't, she was either on a power trip herself, on a particular substance, or to simply put she gave you the dual nuisance message that she truly hates you. She knew you before you knew that you'd eventually know you. So yeah, continue reading, because this is the part where I told you why you need to stop lighting your own ass on fire. You tried every trick in the book, you tried pretending to be an artist on Discord using heart emojis to seduce your victims, you attempted to join a pyramid scheme because you were too stupid enough to make your own disguising it as an MLM, and then you saw me and your primal instinct kicked in, 'Haha! I found him, he is my prey'. Little did you know, your prey was your worst enemy, so now you're here. You thought you were the Erin Moriarty to my Sherlock Holmes, but in actually, you're neither of those things. You live in superficiality, convincing yourself that you can steal other people's numbers, because hardly on your own, you are not a number but a letter instead. You could be the letter 'H', but nope, you became a little girl the moment you turned 6 years old so now you're an 'S', which stands for snake oil. If I could kill a snake, extract its oils, put it into a bottle and sell it your deadbeat dad who left you when you were 10 years old since all he's ever wished for was to dress like a Sailor Moon character and hang out with his equally homosexual best-friends, I could make twice the money you attempted to make trying to scam me. So yeah, next time, please yourself unde a different narrative. Get off of this website, if you ever visit again, I will put ads on here just to prove that I will always use you as bait, not the other way around. If predator goes after prey, I am the prey turned predator. Goodbye, and remember, you're a loser for attempting this.</p>
